## Vision

- [April-Tag-Test](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/team-3467-2023-build-blog/417264/48) 

      We have also done some initial testing with the new 2023.0.1 Limelight 2+ firmware and using the vision client found the following results:
         60 fps at 320x240, ~10ft range
         20 fps at 640x480, ~20ft range
         60 fps at 320x240 2x zoom, ~20ft range
